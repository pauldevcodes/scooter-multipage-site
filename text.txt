  Locate with app

  Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously placing scooters 
  in the areas with most demand, so one should never be too far away. 

  Pick your scooter

  We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So you know how much 
  charge they have left and can see roughly how much it will cost.

  Enjoy the ride

  Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put on a helmet, 
  and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and accessibility ramps.



  Easy to use riding telemetry

  The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it can show you your 
  average speed, how long you've been using the scooter, your traveling distance, 
  and many more things all in an easy to use app.

  FAQs

  How it works

  How do I download the app?

  To download the Scoot app, you can search “Scoot” in both the App and Google Play stores. 
  An even simpler way to do it would be to click the relevant link at the bottom of this 
  page and you’ll be re-directed to the correct page.

  Can I find a nearby Scoots?

  Definitely! Simply open up the app and allow us to find your location while using it. We'll 
  show you all of the closest Scoots and some extra useful information. 

  Do I need a license to ride?

  Yup! We provide information inside the app regarding local laws and the license you need to be 
  able to ride our Scoots.

  Safe driving

  Should I wear a helmet?

  Yes, please do! All cities have different laws. But we strongly strongly strongly recommend 
  always wearing a helmet regardless of the local laws. We like you and we want you to be as 
  safe as possible while Scooting.

  How about the rules & regulations?

  Now is not the time to be a rule breaker. Be sure you're complying with all local laws and 
  regulations. Also, just be a good human being. Be sure not to park your Scoot where it can 
  block access to buildings or get in people's way.

  What if I damage my Scoot?

  Be sure to read our terms and conditions carefully. Not the most fun job we know but we make 
  it as clear as possible. There's an option to add insurance for each trip, or you can sign 
  up for annual insurance if you're a regular Scooter.
